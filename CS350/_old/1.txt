Klondike Solitaire

Dealing
A shuffled standard deck of playing cards are dealt onto the table.
7 columns starting with 1 card on the leftmost column increasing to 7 cards on the rightmost column.
All cards are dealt face down except for the last card in each column.

Foundations
Foundations are built UP and IN SUIT starting with an Ace and ending with a King

Columns
Columns are built DOWN (Ace to King) in ALTERNATING COLOR (red/black).

All face up cards in any Column are available for movement to another Column as long as the build rule is followed.

The topmost card in any Column is available for play to either another Column or a Foundation. When a face down card is the topmost card in a Column, it is flipped face up.

Empty Columns may be filled with any card or cards that may be validly moved.


Stock
Cards from the Stock are flipped three at a time to a Discard Pile. When no cards remain in the Stock, the cards from the Discard Pile can be flipped over and gone through an unlimited number of times.

Discard Pile
Only the top card of the Discard Pile may be played elsewhere. When a card from the Discard Pile is played then the new top card can also be played.

There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:

    * Turning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.
    * Turning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.
    * Turning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once
