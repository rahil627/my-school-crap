AP DB is queried for the bag's destination gate and associates that with a gate. [OLD!]
In routing module, routing algorithm is checked to make sure scanner that scanned bag is in the set of valid scanners to dropoff
AT DB is then queried to find which cart / belt loader is servicing the associated gate
Routing algorithm is checked for each bag that is scanned / in range of cart scanners
State algorithm takes over until bag reaches final destination

about carts
im not sure how you and jeremy were using the scanners table, but here is what i thought you guys meant. each bag is connected to a unique scanner table which consists of booleans. doing this seems redundant because scanner id is never needed.
i think it would be easier to just let the bags have those booleans. i also thought it made more sense to let each bag have a field called scanners with the data type of binary. this would work well with the routing algorithm we discussed, and updating this data can be done with logical operations.

about scanners
each cart has a rfid reader with memory and wifi capabilities. it should be able to send out it's ID to the wifi receiver. when a cart reaches a gate's loading area (it magically knows this), it's ID is sent to the wifi receiver. assuming that each gate has one wifi receiver, [k it's 4AM, this is where i SLEEP XD]

or maybe the gate sends it's ID to the cart? no...gates don't have transmitters

oh gawd...this is awful :(
what if a cart gets near another gate?
ummm, yea we prolly need to go over this portion
