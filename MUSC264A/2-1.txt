rhythm
duple meter


harmony

melody
not a large vareity of notes, very repetitive, but catchy which describes modern rock tunes
from minor than busts out to major

texture
polyphony throughout the entire song

timbre (tone color)
double bass
mainly brass and percussion, as this was a concert no strings

dynamics
woodwinds crecendo/diminuendo repeating
throughout begining than bang with cymbals and loud brass
only to get louder
the percussion is always busy with drums
fitting for the movie, for a dark, sneaky spy
than a fun classy part comes through with the trumpets soaring
and back to the sneaky sounding crecendo and guitar
ending with a nice brass gradually moving up the scale of notes.

form
repitition, only 4 parts repeated and a bridge and ending tangy guitar chord sounded through

guitar
loud brass
Xylophone
