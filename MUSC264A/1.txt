Starts out with the woodwinds flairing with high pitches.
as the brass keeps the melody moving
snare drums drum roll
patriotic brass

I fell asleep somewhere during "Overture to Die Fledermaus" which followed after the "Lion King Soundtrack Highlights".
When the announcer introduced us to the song, I could almost feel a march coming.

"Servicemen on Parade"

the director motioned hand-clapping and everyone started to execute the clapping

As the performance started, the announcer told the audience to stand up when they heard their military service.

I understand why "The Tidewater Winds" play certain songs in every concert.
