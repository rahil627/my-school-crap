Jeremy Sellen
Still the fearless leader and aced another presentation. I was going to present until we found out the same presenter was allowed to present twice...so he presented and I did the SBIR.

Ashley Casper 
Webmaster and finalized all deliverables by making sure they all conformed to a standard design.

Neil Monday
Solid teamate. Just needed to assign him more work...again. His plan didn't look quite comprehensive either, but maybe it wasn't suppose to be.

Joel Elixson
MVP. Joel wrote 3 of the plans making up for Alex. He produced some more high quality presentation charts and stayed up late nights with Jeremy discussing financial digits.

Alexander Hitchens
Fell off...He was assigned a plan, but never did it...He was at the meeting on Monday and did a little work, but other than that, i don't think he did anything else.
