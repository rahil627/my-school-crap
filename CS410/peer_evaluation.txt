Notes
I can only see one person who has scored below a 6, and 2 that have scored a 10.

Jeremy Sellen
Leader and presenter. 10 for professionalism because i believe he is the best speaker/leader in the class. He makes sure group assignments are completed within the time span.

Ashley Casper 
Works very well with Jeremy, documents everything done in every meeting and is the webmaster. She is very reliable show up to every meeting (save emergencies). For the first peer eval, i believe she performed the best.

Neil Monday
Solid teammate. Great contributor during the idea phase. Helped Joel on his workload.

Joel Elixson
Another solid teammate. As the hardware specialist, he had a lot of work for the second presentation.

Alexander Hitchens
I only remember seeing him in maybe 3 meetings. 2 in which he left early. He tried to make a come back before presentation II by posting on the forums, but missed his chance when he did not show up in the 2 crucial meetings prior to the presentation. It's not necessarily a quality problem, just participation.
